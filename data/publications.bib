  abstract = {The evaluation of compound-target interactions (CTIs) is at the heart of drug discovery efforts. Given the substantial time and monetary costs of classical experimental screening, significant efforts have been dedicated to develop deep learning-based models that can accurately predict CTIs. A comprehensive comparison of these models on a large, curated CTI dataset is, however, still lacking. Here, we perform an in-depth comparison of 12 state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that use different protein and compound representations. The models were selected for their reported performance and architectures. To reliably compare model performance, we curated over 300 thousand binding and non-binding CTIs and established several gold-standard datasets of varying size and information. Based on our findings, DeepConv-DTI consistently outperforms other models in CTI prediction performance across the majority of datasets. It achieves an MCC of 0.6 or higher for most of the datasets and is one of the fastest models in training and inference. These results indicate that utilizing convolutional-based windows as in DeepConv-DTI to traverse trainable embeddings is a highly effective approach for capturing informative protein features. We also observed that physicochemical embeddings of targets increased model performance. We therefore modified DeepConv-DTI to include normalized physicochemical properties, which resulted in the overall best performing model Phys-DeepConv-DTI. This work highlights how the systematic evaluation of input features of compounds and targets, as well as their corresponding neural network architectures, can serve as a roadmap for the future development of improved CTI models.},

  abstract = {Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on non-specific immunosuppressive agents, which may have serious adverse effects and be only partially effective. Here, using spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterize inflammatory niches in kidney samples from 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identify proinflammatory, cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a pathogenic signature. We then utilize these transcriptomic profiles for digital pharmacology and identify ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23, as the strongest therapeutic drug to use. Moreover, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN are treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and steroids, with ustekinumab given subcutaneously (90\,mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Patients are followed up for 26 weeks to find this treatment well-tolerated and inducing clinical responses, including improved kidney function and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, in all ANCA-GN patients. Our findings thus suggest that targeting of pathogenic T cells in ANCA-GN patients with ustekinumab might represent a potential approach and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis is a severe kidney complication driven by immune cells, including T cells. However, the mechanisms underlying T cell activation in these contexts remain elusive. Here we report that in patients with AAV and SLE, type I interferon (IFN-I) induces T cell differentiation into interferon-stimulated genes-expressing T (ISG-T) cells, which are characterized by an elevated IFN-I signature, an immature phenotype, and cytotoxicity in inflamed tissue. Mechanistically, IFN-I stimulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in T cells, which in turn induces granzyme B production. In mice, blocking IFN-I signaling reduces IRF7 and granzyme B expression in T cells, thus ameliorating glomerulonephritis. In parallel, spatial transcriptomic analyses of kidney biopsies from patients with AAV or SLE reveal an elevated ISG signature and the presence of ISG-T cells in close proximity to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the primary producers of IFN-I. Our results from both patients and animal models thus suggest that IFN-I production in inflamed tissue may drive ISG-T cell differentiation to expand the pool of cytotoxic T cells in autoimmune diseases.},

These functional domains often exist at multiple spatial scales, with larger domains encompassing smaller ones, reflecting the hierarchical organization of biological systems. However, the identification of these functional domain hierarchies has been hardly explored due to the lack of appropriate computational methods. In this work, we present SCALE, an unsupervised algorithm for multi-scale domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data. SCALE combines neural graph representation learning with an entropy-based search algorithm to detect functional domains at different scales. It reaches state-of-the-art performance in single- and multi-scale domain detection on simulated and murine brain Xenium and MERFISH data, as well as patient-derived kidney tissue, highlighting its robustness and scalability across diverse tissue types and platforms. SCALE's ease of use makes it a powerful aid for advancing our understanding of tissue organization and function in health and disease.},
