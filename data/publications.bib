  abstract = {The evaluation of compound-target interactions (CTIs) is at the heart of drug discovery efforts. Given the substantial time and monetary costs of classical experimental screening, significant efforts have been dedicated to develop deep learning-based models that can accurately predict CTIs. A comprehensive comparison of these models on a large, curated CTI dataset is, however, still lacking. Here, we perform an in-depth comparison of 12 state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that use different protein and compound representations. The models were selected for their reported performance and architectures. To reliably compare model performance, we curated over 300 thousand binding and non-binding CTIs and established several gold-standard datasets of varying size and information. Based on our findings, DeepConv-DTI consistently outperforms other models in CTI prediction performance across the majority of datasets. It achieves an MCC of 0.6 or higher for most of the datasets and is one of the fastest models in training and inference. These results indicate that utilizing convolutional-based windows as in DeepConv-DTI to traverse trainable embeddings is a highly effective approach for capturing informative protein features. We also observed that physicochemical embeddings of targets increased model performance. We therefore modified DeepConv-DTI to include normalized physicochemical properties, which resulted in the overall best performing model Phys-DeepConv-DTI. This work highlights how the systematic evaluation of input features of compounds and targets, as well as their corresponding neural network architectures, can serve as a roadmap for the future development of improved CTI models.},

  abstract = {Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on non-specific immunosuppressive agents, which may have serious adverse effects and be only partially effective. Here, using spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterize inflammatory niches in kidney samples from 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identify proinflammatory, cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a pathogenic signature. We then utilize these transcriptomic profiles for digital pharmacology and identify ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23, as the strongest therapeutic drug to use. Moreover, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN are treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and steroids, with ustekinumab given subcutaneously (90\,mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Patients are followed up for 26 weeks to find this treatment well-tolerated and inducing clinical responses, including improved kidney function and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, in all ANCA-GN patients. Our findings thus suggest that targeting of pathogenic T cells in ANCA-GN patients with ustekinumab might represent a potential approach and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is the most aggressive group of autoimmune kidney diseases and is characterized by glomerular crescent formation with proliferation of parietal epithelial cells (PECs). However, the underlying mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation are incompletely understood. Here we provide a high-resolution spatial kidney cell atlas of 57 samples from patients with RPGN (ANCA-associated GN, lupus nephritis and anti-glomerular basement membrane-GN) to characterize the cell signaling pathways in glomerular crescent development. Early platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling from epithelial and mesangial cells caused PEC activation and proliferation in glomerular crescents, whereas later transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$} signaling from macrophages, T cells and epithelial and mesangial cells triggered expression of extracellular matrix components in PECs associated with glomerulosclerosis and disease progression. These findings were similar across the different GNs and were functionally validated in experimental GN by PDGF and TGF{$\beta$} blockade. These results highlight a spatiotemporally conserved progression program into glomerular crescents and sclerosis and indicate new treatment options for autoimmune kidney disease.},

  abstract = {In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis is a severe kidney complication driven by immune cells, including T cells. However, the mechanisms underlying T cell activation in these contexts remain elusive. Here we report that in patients with AAV and SLE, type I interferon (IFN-I) induces T cell differentiation into interferon-stimulated genes-expressing T (ISG-T) cells, which are characterized by an elevated IFN-I signature, an immature phenotype, and cytotoxicity in inflamed tissue. Mechanistically, IFN-I stimulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in T cells, which in turn induces granzyme B production. In mice, blocking IFN-I signaling reduces IRF7 and granzyme B expression in T cells, thus ameliorating glomerulonephritis. In parallel, spatial transcriptomic analyses of kidney biopsies from patients with AAV or SLE reveal an elevated ISG signature and the presence of ISG-T cells in close proximity to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the primary producers of IFN-I. Our results from both patients and animal models thus suggest that IFN-I production in inflamed tissue may drive ISG-T cell differentiation to expand the pool of cytotoxic T cells in autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases like crescentic glomerulonephritis (cGN), but their immunosuppressive functions are not fully understood. Here, we generated a single immune cell sequencing atlas at different stages of experimental cGN. We identified a proinflammatory neutrophil subset as important for disease progression and as a glucocorticoid target. Such neutrophils produced proinflammatory cytokines known to drive cGN and expressed Siglec-F and decoy tumor necrosis factor--related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 1 (dcTRAIL-R1) in mice and SIGLEC8 in humans. Depleting such neutrophils attenuated disease in mice, whereas their adoptive transfer aggravated disease. They differentiated within the inflamed kidney in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreted by clonally expanded CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17) cells and persisted locally longer than normal neutrophils. Glucocorticoids decreased intrarenal numbers of TH17 cells and down-regulated GM-CSF receptor expression by neutrophils and reduced their cytokine production. Selective genetic reduction of glucocorticoid receptor expression in neutrophils reenabled their in vivo differentiation during glucocorticoid therapy and aggravated cGN. Low glucocorticoid doses were sufficient to prevent intrarenal neutrophil differentiation in mice, if applied repetitively, even without an initial high-dose steroid pulse. Spatial sequencing of kidney biopsies, especially from patients with high disease activity, uncovered similar neutrophils in intrarenal inflammatory niches, and their abundance was lower after repetitive low-dose glucocorticoid application. These findings identify proinflammatory neutrophils as progression drivers in cGN and suggest that low-dose glucocorticoid therapy may be sufficient to suppress them.}

  abstract = {Single-cell spatial transcriptomics enables precise mapping of cellular states and functional domains within their native tissue environment. These functional domains often exist at multiple spatial scales, with larger domains encompassing smaller ones, reflecting the hierarchical organization of biological systems. However, the identification of these functional domain hierarchies has been largely unexplored due to the lack of suitable computational methods. In this work, we present SCALE, an unsupervised algorithm for multiscale domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data. SCALE combines deep learning-based graph representation learning with an entropy-based search algorithm to detect functional domains at different scales. We demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying~multiscale domains using both simulated data and spatial transcriptomics data from murine brain (Xenium and MERFISH) and patient-derived kidney tissue, highlighting its robustness and scalability across diverse tissue types and platforms. SCALE outperforms state-of-the-art multidomain identification by up to 191.1 percentage points. SCALE's ease of use makes it a powerful aid for advancing our understanding of tissue organization and function in health and disease.},
