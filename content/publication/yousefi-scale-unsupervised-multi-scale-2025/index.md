abstract: Single-cell spatial transcriptomics enables precise mapping of cellular
  states and functional domains within their native tissue environment. These functional
  domains often exist at multiple spatial scales, with larger domains encompassing
  smaller ones, reflecting the hierarchical organization of biological systems. However,
  the identification of these functional domain hierarchies has been hardly explored
  due to the lack of appropriate computational methods. In this work, we present SCALE,
  an unsupervised algorithm for multi-scale domain identification in spatial transcriptomics
  data. SCALE combines neural graph representation learning with an entropy-based
  search algorithm to detect functional domains at different scales. It reaches state-of-the-art
  performance in single- and multi-scale domain detection on simulated and murine
  brain Xenium and MERFISH data, as well as patient-derived kidney tissue, highlighting
  its robustness and scalability across diverse tissue types and platforms. SCALEâ€™s
  ease of use makes it a powerful aid for advancing our understanding of tissue organization
  and function in health and disease.
