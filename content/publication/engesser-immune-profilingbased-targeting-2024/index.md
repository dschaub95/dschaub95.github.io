abstract: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis is a life-threatening
  autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis
  (GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on non-specific immunosuppressive
  agents, which may have serious adverse effects and be only partially effective.
  Here, using spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterize inflammatory
  niches in kidney samples from 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identify proinflammatory,
  cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a pathogenic signature. We then utilize
  these transcriptomic profiles for digital pharmacology and identify ustekinumab,
  a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23, as the strongest therapeutic drug
  to use. Moreover, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN are treated with ustekinumab
  in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and steroids, with ustekinumab given
  subcutaneously (90,mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Patients are followed up for 26
  weeks to find this treatment well-tolerated and inducing clinical responses, including
  improved kidney function and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, in all ANCA-GN
  patients. Our findings thus suggest that targeting of pathogenic T cells in ANCA-GN
  patients with ustekinumab might represent a potential approach and warrants further
  investigation in clinical trials.
