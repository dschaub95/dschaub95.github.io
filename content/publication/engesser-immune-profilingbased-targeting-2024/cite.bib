 abstract = {Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis is a life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on non-specific immunosuppressive agents, which may have serious adverse effects and be only partially effective. Here, using spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterize inflammatory niches in kidney samples from 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identify proinflammatory, cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a pathogenic signature. We then utilize these transcriptomic profiles for digital pharmacology and identify ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23, as the strongest therapeutic drug to use. Moreover, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN are treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and steroids, with ustekinumab given subcutaneously (90\,mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Patients are followed up for 26 weeks to find this treatment well-tolerated and inducing clinical responses, including improved kidney function and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, in all ANCA-GN patients. Our findings thus suggest that targeting of pathogenic T cells in ANCA-GN patients with ustekinumab might represent a potential approach and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.},
