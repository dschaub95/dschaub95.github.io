abstract: The identification of biologically meaningful domains is a central step
  in the analysis of spatial transcriptomic data.Following Occamâ€™s razor, we show
  that a simple PCA-based algorithm for unsupervised spatial domain identification
  rivals the performance of ten competing state-of-the-art methods across six single-cell
  spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our reductionist approach, NichePCA, provides researchers
  with intuitive domain interpretation and excels in execution speed, robustness,
  and scalability.The code is available at https://github.com/imsb-uke/nichepca.
