 abstract = {Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is the most aggressive group of autoimmune kidney disease with the worst prognosis. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) and lupus nephritis are the most common causes of RPGN and are characterized by the formation of glomerular crescents and infiltration of leukocytes that eventually lead to glomerulosclerosis and kidney failure.},
