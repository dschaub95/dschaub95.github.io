 abstract = {Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with high morbidity. Advancement in high-throughput multi-omics approaches has enabled the collection of molecular assessments at different layers, providing a complementary perspective of complex diseases. Numerous computational methods have been developed for the omics-based patient classification or disease outcome prediction. Yet, a systematic benchmarking of those methods using various combinations of omics data for the prediction of asthma development is still lacking.},
