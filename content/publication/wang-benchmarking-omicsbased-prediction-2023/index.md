abstract: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with high morbidity. Advancement in high-throughput
  multi-omics approaches has enabled the collection of molecular assessments at different
  layers, providing a complementary perspective of complex diseases. Numerous computational
  methods have been developed for the omics-based patient classification or disease
  outcome prediction. Yet, a systematic benchmarking of those methods using various
  combinations of omics data for the prediction of asthma development is still lacking.
