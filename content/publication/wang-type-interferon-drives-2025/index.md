abstract: In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and
  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis is a severe kidney complication
  driven by immune cells, including T cells. However, the mechanisms underlying T
  cell activation in these contexts remain elusive. Here we report that in patients
  with AAV and SLE, type I interferon (IFN-I) induces T cell differentiation into
  interferon-stimulated genes-expressing T (ISG-T) cells, which are characterized
  by an elevated IFN-I signature, an immature phenotype, and cytotoxicity in inflamed
  tissue. Mechanistically, IFN-I stimulates the expression of interferon regulatory
  factor 7 (IRF7) in T cells, which in turn induces granzyme B production. In mice,
  blocking IFN-I signaling reduces IRF7 and granzyme B expression in T cells, thus
  ameliorating glomerulonephritis. In parallel, spatial transcriptomic analyses of
  kidney biopsies from patients with AAV or SLE reveal an elevated ISG signature and
  the presence of ISG-T cells in close proximity to plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
  the primary producers of IFN-I. Our results from both patients and animal models
  thus suggest that IFN-I production in inflamed tissue may drive ISG-T cell differentiation
  to expand the pool of cytotoxic T cells in autoimmune diseases.
