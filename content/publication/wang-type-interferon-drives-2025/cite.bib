 abstract = {In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis is a severe kidney complication driven by immune cells, including T cells. However, the mechanisms underlying T cell activation in these contexts remain elusive. Here we report that in patients with AAV and SLE, type I interferon (IFN-I) induces T cell differentiation into interferon-stimulated genes-expressing T (ISG-T) cells, which are characterized by an elevated IFN-I signature, an immature phenotype, and cytotoxicity in inflamed tissue. Mechanistically, IFN-I stimulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in T cells, which in turn induces granzyme B production. In mice, blocking IFN-I signaling reduces IRF7 and granzyme B expression in T cells, thus ameliorating glomerulonephritis. In parallel, spatial transcriptomic analyses of kidney biopsies from patients with AAV or SLE reveal an elevated ISG signature and the presence of ISG-T cells in close proximity to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the primary producers of IFN-I. Our results from both patients and animal models thus suggest that IFN-I production in inflamed tissue may drive ISG-T cell differentiation to expand the pool of cytotoxic T cells in autoimmune diseases.},
